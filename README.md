# Shared Lootr

Shared Lootr is a thin compatibility layer for Lootr. Lootr remains the sole owner of container conversion, block entities, menus, renderers, models, textures, particles, packets, and persistence; this project changes only inventory and opened-state ownership from per-player to global.

## Behavior

- Lootr converts supported generated chests, trapped chests, barrels, shulker boxes, minecarts, and tagged custom inventories through its native paths.
- Every player sees and modifies the same inventory for a given Lootr container.
- Opening a container once marks it opened globally while preserving Lootr's native unopened and opened visuals.
- Existing per-player Lootr inventories are retained; the populated canonical inventory becomes the shared one on first access.
- No vanilla container mixin, custom block entity, renderer, model, texture, particle, or packet is provided here.

## Compatibility target
